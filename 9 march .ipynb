    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on a countable number of possible values. It gives the probability of each possible outcome. The PMF maps each value of the random variable to its corresponding probability.\n",
    "For example, consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of a single roll. The PMF of X would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF(X = 1) = 1/6\n",
    "PMF(X = 2) = 1/6\n",

    "Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "The PDF is used for continuous random variables, which can take on any value within a certain range. The PDF represents the relative likelihood of the random variable taking on a specific value within that range. The total probability is obtained by integrating the PDF over a certain interval.\n",
    "For example, let's consider a continuous random variable X that follows a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). The PDF of X would be denoted as f(x). Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, the PDF would be bell-shaped.\n",

    "Quality Control: The normal distribution is used in quality control to model the distribution of process measurements or product characteristics. It helps in determining acceptable limits and identifying deviations from the norm.\n",

    "Statistical Inference: Many statistical methods and hypothesis tests are based on assumptions of normality. For instance, in hypothesis testing, assumptions are often made about the distribution of data, and the normal distribution is frequently used due to its tractability and robustness.\n",
